          Generalitat administration with the people who have the status of interest
          group in the time period you select. You will also find the gifts and invitations
          allowed by the Code of Conduct, which forces senior management to make this
          information public. Likewise, the viewer allows to consult the trips abroad
          of the President, advisors and senior positions in the exercise of their
          functions.
        description_2_html: Regarding the information of the senior management, the last
          position they occupy or have occupied in the last activity registered is
